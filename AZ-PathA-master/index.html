	I'm sure you are dying to know who Bernie Sanders is. But, honestly you probably already know him because he is the greatest and most kindest person to ever walk this planet. In saying this, he is running for president. Many of the youngins know him and would vote for him, but there's only one problem: they are younger than 18. Now, this is a big problem because that leaves all the older people to vote and thats more balanced than the younger generation is, Gen Z. I would say, more or less, Gen Z is more towards the liberal side. Anyways, the mIlLeNiaLs are too busy with their own lives to go vote. This is a BIG problem because now it leaves the OLDER older people to vote. These are the old people that lived in the bad times: racism, sexism, no rightsism. And who do you think they are voting for: the conservative republicans a.k.a. Trump. A vote for Trump is a vote for inequality. But, a vote for Bernie is a vote for free medicare, basic human rights, gender and racial equality, and all the things the U.S. used to stand for. He is 78 years old and was born in Brooklyn. Right now, he lives in Burlington Vermont. He was also the former mayor of Burlington and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, then was elected to the Senate in 2006. He was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary.
