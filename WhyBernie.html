	This is a pretty solid list and if you dont like what is on this, then you probably don't believe in equality or justice and thats just you going against the fundamental rights of the constitution and the founding fathers. if you want to be patriotic and stuff then why don't you actually live by the constitution and not cite it all the time just to back your side of things.
